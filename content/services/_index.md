- **AI Engineering:** I design and implement AI-powered solutions tailored to business needs, including natural language processing, predictive modeling, and generative AI applications. By leveraging the latest machine learning and large language model technologies, I enable clients to automate workflows, enhance customer experiences, and unlock new sources of value from their data. (Python, LangChain, RAG, Transformers, Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc...)
- **Analytics & Visualizations:** I provide data analysis and visualization services that transform raw data into clear, actionable insights. From interactive dashboards to advanced statistical analysis, I help clients uncover trends, identify opportunities, and make data-driven decisions with confidence. (Python, Tableau, Power BI)
- **Cloud Integration:** I can help businesses deploy and scale solutions in the cloud using platforms like AWS and Azure. From migrating databases to implementing cloud-based analytics and AI, I ensure systems are secure, cost-efficient, and highly available. My cloud integration services allow clients to modernize infrastructure, improve collaboration, and innovate faster. (Python, AWS, Azure, Docker, GitHub Actions, S3-compatible storage, etc...)
- **Data Engineering:** I build robust data pipelines and architectures that ensure data is collected, cleaned, and delivered efficiently to the right systems. From database design to ETL/ELT processes and real-time streaming, I make data reliable, scalable, and ready for analytics or AI. This helps clients reduce bottlenecks, improve reporting accuracy, and prepare for long-term growth. (Python, SQL, NoSQL, ETL/ELT, Postgres, MongoDB, etc...)
