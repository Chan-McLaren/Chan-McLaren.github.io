## Superstore Sales Dashboard 

The following dashboards, built in Tableau Public with the Superstpre dataset, illustrate the progression from a simple high-level view to a more advanced analytical solution. The first dashboard delivers quick insights into yearly sales performance, showing how Tableau can rapidly create clarity from raw data. The second, more complex dashboard builds on this foundation, layering in year-over-year comparisons and deeper analysis to uncover trends and patterns that support stronger business decisions. Together, they highlight the range of insights that can be achieved=from fast overviews to detailed, interactive exploration.
