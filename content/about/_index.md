Hi, I’m Chandler McLaren—a data professional with a unique journey that blends athletics, engineering, and technology.

I began my career as a professional baseball player, competing globally and learning firsthand the power of performance data in driving results. After retiring from the game, I transitioned into the aerospace industry as a Chemical Processing Specialist at Collins Aerospace, where I developed a technical foundation in engineering processes, precision systems, and problem-solving under high standards of quality and safety.

Today, I bring those diverse experiences together through CM Data Solutions, where I specialize in helping businesses harness the power of data engineering, analytics, AI, and cloud integration to make smarter, faster decisions. My approach combines the discipline of engineering with the creativity of analytics—building solutions that are both technically sound and strategically impactful.

Whether it’s designing scalable data pipelines, integrating cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, applying machine learning and AI models to solve complex challenges, or delivering actionable insights through dashboards and analytics, I focus on creating end-to-end solutions tailored to each client’s needs.

My mission is simple: turn data into a competitive advantage.

If you’re looking for a partner who understands the game—whether on the field, in the lab, or in the cloud—I’d love to help you unlock the full potential of your data.
